# Hjerne

Hjerne is a Django-based application for managing projects, changesets, and contexts. It uses Tree-sitter to understand code and supports sending changesets into a changeset file or the Emacs ChatGPT-shell buffer, and merging the updated code directly back into your project.

## Features

- üìÅ **Project Management**: Add, list, and manage projects. Each project has an ID, title, and description.
- üå≥ **Changeset Management**: Add, list, and manage changesets within a project. Changesets represent a collection of changes or contexts.
- üìù **Context Management**: Add, remove, and update contexts within a changeset. Contexts represent specific code elements (like functions, classes, or variables).
- üåê **Integration with Tree-sitter**: Utilize Tree-sitter for parsing and analyzing source code to identify top-level symbols and nodes.
- üß† **Integration with ChatGPT**: Send and receive context code to and from a ChatGPT shell for code analysis or generation.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Elisp Integration**: Integrate with Emacs, providing functions to interact with Django management commands and manage projects, changesets, and contexts.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Django Admin**: Manage projects, changesets, and contexts through the Django admin interface.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Hydra Menu**: Uses Hydra in Emacs for easy access to various management functions.

## Management Commands

Hjerne provides a set of Django management commands to interact with projects, changesets, and contexts. For a detailed list of all available commands and their usage, please refer to the [MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md](MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md) file.

These commands cover various aspects of the application, including:

- Project Management
- Changeset Management
- Context Management
- Tree-sitter Integration

You can run these commands using the Django `manage.py` script. For example:

```
python manage.py project_add "My Project" "This is a description of my project"
```

For more information on each command and its arguments, please consult the MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS.md file.

## Emacs Integration

Hjerne provides a set of Emacs Lisp functions to interact with the Django management commands and manage projects, changesets, and contexts directly from Emacs. The functions are accessible through a Hydra menu for easy access.

### Installation

To use Hjerne with Emacs, add the following to your `init.el` file:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/hjerne/src")
(require 'hjerne)
(setq hjerne-install-path "/path/to/hjerne/src")
(setq hjerne-replacement-file "/path/to/changeset.py")
(setq hjerne-python-executable-path "/path/to/python")
(setq chatgpt-shell-prompt-query-response-style 'shell)
```

### Key Functions

- `hjerne-project-add`: Add a new project and update `hjerne-project-id`.
- `hjerne-project-select`: Select a project and set `hjerne-project-id`.
- `hjerne-changeset-add`: Add a new changeset to the current project.
- `hjerne-changeset-select`: Select a changeset for the given project and set `hjerne-changeset-id`.
- `hjerne-context-add-dwim`: Add context to a changeset using the current line in the active buffer or a selected region.
- `hjerne-context-remove-dwim`: Remove context from a changeset using the current line in the active buffer or a selected region.
- `hjerne-context-code`: Output code for a given changeset and write to the replacement file.
- `hjerne-context-update-markdown`: Update the context for a given changeset using a markdown file.
- `hjerne-send-context-code-to-chatgpt-shell`: Send context code to ChatGPT shell with a prefix message.
- `hjerne-receive-replacement-from-chatgpt-shell`: Receive replacement from ChatGPT shell, update context, and regenerate context code.
- `hjerne-changeset-clear-context`: Clear all contexts in the current changeset.
- `hjerne-context-add-ag`: Add contexts from the current ag-mode buffer to the current changeset.

### Hydra Menu

Hjerne provides a Hydra menu for easy access to its functions:
